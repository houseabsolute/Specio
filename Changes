- Now with lots more documentation, but this is still very alpha. Feedback
  from potential users is welcome.

- First release upon an unsuspecting world. This is very alpha and subject to
  change. I'm mostly releasing it to get some feedback on the design. Do not
  use this in your code yet, unless you promise not to complain about the lack
  of docs or the fact that the next release breaks your code.
